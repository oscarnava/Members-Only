# Members Only!

### Authors: [Mauricio Robayo](https://github.com/MauricioRobayo) & [Oscar Nava](https://github.com/oscarnava/)

This project is for an exclusive clubhouse where members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

You can execute:

```
rails db:seed
```

to fill the database with dummy entries.
